# cyverse.ds.irods_cfg

This role will eventually be able to be used to completely configure an iRODS server once iRODS is installed. At the moment, it can maintain the following configuration files.

- irods_environment.json
- etc/irods/server_config.json
- etc/irods/service_account.config

## Requirements

iRODS 4.3.3 is installed.

## Tasks Files

The `main.yml` tasks file that is called by default performs the same tasks as `server.yml`, i.e., it deploys the set of files required by an iRODS server.

There are two tier-specific tasks files. `client.yml` deploys the configuration files required by a client, e.g., the iCommands. Currently, it deploys the irods_environment.json file. `server.yml` deploys the configuration files required by an iRODS server.

For each iRODS configuration file there is a corresponding tasks file that deploys only that configuration file. `irods_environment.yml` deploys the client or clerver configuration file, _irods_environment.json_ by default. In the `etc/irods/` directory, `server_config.yml` deploys server_config.json and `service_account.yml` deploys service_account.config.

The `setup_irods.yml` task file is not part of `main.yml` or either of the tier-specific tasks files. `setup_irods.yml` initializes the ICAT DB before calling `server.yml`.

## Role Variables

Here are the role variables. None of them are required.
