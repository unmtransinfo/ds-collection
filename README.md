# Ansible Collection - cyverse.ds (modified for SW CACTI)

Modification of cyverse.ds playbooks to work on Ubuntu 24 systems.

Forked from: https://github.com/cyverse/ds-collection

## Prerequisites

Only Ubuntu 24.04 is supported at this time.

The following actions need to be performed once for the admin host.

1. The Docker package repository needs to be configured on development machines and Ansible control nodes. Do the following.

   ```shell
   sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
   sudo mkdir --parents /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl --fail --location --silent --show-error https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
      | sudo gpg --dearmor --output /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
         https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
         $(lsb_release --codename --short) stable" \
      | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
   sudo apt update
   ```

1. The following system packages need to be installed on development machines and Ansible control nodes.
   - dmidecode
   - docker-ce
   - docker-compose-plugin
   - git
   - jq
   - python-is-python3
   - python3
   - python3-pip
   - rpm

   ```shell
   sudo apt install \
      dmidecode docker-ce docker-compose-plugin git jq python-is-python3 python3 python3-pip rpm
   ```

1. The docker service needs to be started.

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

The following actions need to be performed for each person who will be developing or deploying the Data Store.

1. The person needs to be added to the `docker` group. The following assumes the person's username is `DEVELOPER`.

   ```shell
   sudo usermod --append --groups docker DEVELOPER
   ```

1. The following python packages need to be installed on the development machines and Ansible control nodes using `pip`.
   - ansible-core<2.17.0
   - ansible-lint
   - dnspython
   - docker
   - jsonschema
   - molecule
   - molecule-plugins
   - netaddr
   - paramiko
   - python-irodsclient
   - requests
   - scp
   - tox-ansible
   - wheel

   This is encapsulated in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

   ```shell
   pip install --requirement requirements.txt
   ```

1. The ansible collections and roles need to be installed.

   ```shell
   ansible-galaxy install --requirements-file requirements.yml
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All VMs (including the Ansible Control Node, if that is a VM) shall install `rng-tools` using the playbook `infra_rng_tools.yml`. This ensures that ansible tasks have efficient entropy in generating random numbers, preventing unexpected pauses in deployment.
